    The JSON output contains size information. For files, the child size
    is the total size of the file contents. For directories, the child
    size is the IPFS link size.
    
    The path can be a prefixless ref; in this case, we assume it to be an
    /ipfs ref and not /ipns.
    
    Example:
    
        > ipfs file ls QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ
        cat.jpg
        > ipfs file ls /ipfs/QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ
        cat.jpg
