    Multihashes are hard to remember, but domain names are usually easy to
    remember.  To create memorable aliases for multihashes, DNS TXT
    records can point to other DNS links, IPFS objects, IPNS keys, etc.
    This command resolves those links to the referenced object.

    Multihashes are hard to remember, but domain names are usually easy to
    remember.  To create memorable aliases for multihashes, DNS TXT
    records can point to other DNS links, IPFS objects, IPNS keys, etc.
    This command resolves those links to the referenced object.
    
    For example, with this DNS TXT record:
    
    	> dig +short TXT ipfs.io
    	dnslink=/ipfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy
    
    The resolver will give:
    
    	> ipfs dns ipfs.io
    	/ipfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy
    
    The resolver can recursively resolve:
    
    	> dig +short TXT recursive.ipfs.io
    	dnslink=/ipns/ipfs.io
    	> ipfs dns -r recursive.ipfs.io
    	/ipfs/QmRzTuh2Lpuz7Gr39stNr6mTFdqAghsZec1JoUnfySUzcy
