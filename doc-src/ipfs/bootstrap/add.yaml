    SECURITY WARNING:
    
    The bootstrap command manipulates the "bootstrap list", which contains
    the addresses of bootstrap nodes. These are the *trusted peers* from
    which to learn about other peers in the network. Only edit this list
    if you understand the risks of adding or removing nodes from this list.
