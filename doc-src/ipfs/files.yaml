  short: |
    Files is an API for manipulating IPFS objects as if they were a unix
    filesystem.
    
    NOTE:
    Most of the subcommands of 'ipfs files' accept the '--flush' flag. It defaults
    to true. Use caution when setting this flag to false. It will improve
    performance for large numbers of file operations, but it does so at the cost
    of consistency guarantees. If the daemon is unexpectedly killed before running
    'ipfs files flush' on the files in question, then data may be lost. This also
    applies to running 'ipfs repo gc' concurrently with '--flush=false'
    operations.
