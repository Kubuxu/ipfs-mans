  short: |
    'ipfs swarm filters' will list out currently applied filters. Its subcommands
    can be used to add or remove said filters. Filters are specified using the
    multiaddr-filter format:
    
    Example:
    
        /ip4/192.168.0.0/ipcidr/16
    
    Where the above is equivalent to the standard CIDR:
    
        192.168.0.0/16
    
    Filters default to those specified under the "Swarm.AddrFilters" config key.
