  short: |
    'ipfs swarm disconnect' closes a connection to a peer address. The address
    format is an ipfs multiaddr:
    
    ipfs swarm disconnect /ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
    
    The disconnect is not permanent; if ipfs needs to talk to that address later,
    it will reconnect.
