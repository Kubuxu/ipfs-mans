  tagline: Generates a network diagnostics report.
  short: |
    Sends out a message to each node in the network recursively
    requesting a listing of data about them including number of
    connected peers and latencies between them.
    
    The given timeout will be decremented 2s at every network hop, 
    ensuring peers try to return their diagnostics before the initiator's 
    timeout. If the timeout is too small, some peers may not be reached.
    30s and 60s are reasonable timeout values, though networks vary.
    The default timeout is 20 seconds.
    
    The 'vis' option may be used to change the output format.
    Three formats are supported:
     * text - Easy to read. Default.
     * d3 - json ready to be fed into d3view
     * dot - graphviz format
    
    The 'd3' format will output a json object ready to be consumed by
    the chord network viewer, available at the following hash:
    
        /ipfs/QmbesKpGyQGd5jtJFUGEB1ByPjNFpukhnKZDnkfxUiKn38
    
    To view your diag output, 'ipfs add' the d3 vis output, and
    open the following link:
    
    	http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbesKpGyQGd5jtJFUGEB1ByPjNFpukhnKZDnkfxUiKn38/chord#<your hash>
    
    The 'dot' format can be fed into graphviz and other programs
    that consume the dot format to generate graphs of the network.
