help:
  tagline: Write to a mutable file in a given filesystem.
  short: |
    Write data to a file in a given filesystem. This command allows you to specify
    a beginning offset to write to. The entire length of the input will be written.
    
    If the '--create' option is specified, the file will be created if it does not
    exist. Nonexistant intermediate directories will not be created.
    
    If the '--flush' option is set to false, changes will not be propogated to the
    merkledag root. This can make operations much faster when doing a large number
    of writes to a deeper directory structure.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    
        echo "hello world" | ipfs files write --create /myfs/a/b/file
        echo "hello world" | ipfs files write --truncate /myfs/a/b/file
    
    WARNING:
    
    Usage of the '--flush=false' option does not guarantee data durability until
    the tree has been flushed. This can be accomplished by running 'ipfs files
    stat' on the file or any of its ancestors.
