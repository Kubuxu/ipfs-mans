  tagline: Given a key, query the DHT for its best value.
  short: |
    Outputs the best value for the given key.
    
    There may be several different values for a given key stored in the DHT; in
    this context 'best' means the record that is most desirable. There is no one
    metric for 'best': it depends entirely on the key type. For IPNS, 'best' is
    the record that is both valid and has the highest sequence number (freshest).
    Different key types can specify other 'best' rules.
