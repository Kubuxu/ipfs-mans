  tagline: Write a key/value pair to the DHT.
  short: |
    Given a key of the form /foo/bar and a value of any form, this will write that
    value to the DHT with that key.
    
    Keys have two parts: a keytype (foo) and the key name (bar). IPNS uses the
    /ipns keytype, and expects the key name to be a Peer ID. IPNS entries are
    specifically formatted (protocol buffer).
    
    You may only use keytypes that are supported in your ipfs binary: currently
    this is only /ipns. Unless you have a relatively deep understanding of the
    go-ipfs DHT internals, you likely want to be using 'ipfs name publish' instead
    of this.
    
    Value is arbitrary text. Standard input can be used to provide value.
    
    NOTE: A value may not exceed 2048 bytes.
