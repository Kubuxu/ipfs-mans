  tagline: Append data to the data segment of a dag node.
  short: |
    Append data to what already exists in the data segment in the given object.
    
    Example:
    
    	$ echo "hello" | ipfs object patch $HASH append-data
    
    NOTE: This does not append data to a file - it modifies the actual raw
    data within an object. Objects have a max size of 1MB and objects larger than
    the limit will not be respected by the network.
