    There are a number of mutable name protocols that can link among
    themselves and into IPNS. For example IPNS references can (currently)
    point at an IPFS object, and DNS links can point at other DNS links, IPNS
    entries, or IPFS objects. This command accepts any of these
    identifiers and resolves them to the referenced item.
    
    EXAMPLES
    
    Resolve the value of your identity:
    
      $ ipfs resolve /ipns/QmatmE9msSfkKxoffpHwNLNKgwZG8eT9Bud6YoPab52vpy
      /ipfs/Qmcqtw8FfrVSBaRmbWwHxt3AuySBhJLcvmFYi3Lbc4xnwj
    
    Resolve the value of another name:
    
      $ ipfs resolve /ipns/QmbCMUZw6JFeZ7Wp9jkzbye3Fzp2GGcPgC3nmeUjfVF87n
      /ipns/QmatmE9msSfkKxoffpHwNLNKgwZG8eT9Bud6YoPab52vpy
    
    Resolve the value of another name recursively:
    
      $ ipfs resolve -r /ipns/QmbCMUZw6JFeZ7Wp9jkzbye3Fzp2GGcPgC3nmeUjfVF87n
      /ipfs/Qmcqtw8FfrVSBaRmbWwHxt3AuySBhJLcvmFYi3Lbc4xnwj
    
    Resolve the value of an IPFS DAG path:
    
      $ ipfs resolve /ipfs/QmeZy1fGbwgVSrqbfh9fKQrAWgeyRnj7h8fsHS1oy3k99x/beep/boop
      /ipfs/QmYRMjyvAiHKN9UTi8Bzt1HUspmSRD8T8DwxfSMzLgBon1
